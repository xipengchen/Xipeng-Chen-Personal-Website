## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="chen.JPG">

I am a PhD candidate at Jilin University. I work with Dr. Weidong Zhang in the intersection of Human Computer Interaction (HCID), Computer Science, and Digital Humanity.

My research methods, generally, involve a mixed-methods approach with an eventual objective to translate my research insights into scalable and impactful technological solutions. With the constant push of AI based technologies into emerging markets, I am also interested in looking at how such technologies can be leveraged by facilitators to provide scalable, but human-centered coaching to improve professional wellbeing in working communities.

## Research Interest

My research focuses on understanding how everyday technologies impact different aspects of work, such as professional wellbeing, in digital labor. To that extent, I have worked with various service workers and stakeholders to understand how technologies, such as WhatsApp, create empowerment opportunities that can be leveraged to reduce job demands and improve professional wellbeing.
