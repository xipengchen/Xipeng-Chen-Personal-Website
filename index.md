## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="chen.JPG">

I’m currently a PhD candidate in Information Science at [Jilin University](https://global.jlu.edu.cn/), where I’m advised by Dr. Weidong Zhang in the intersection of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer Science, and Digital Humanity. I have a master’s degree in Quantitative Economics from Yeshiva University and have worked as a data analyst at places like Wellway Health and Open Road Integrated Media.

My research methods, generally, involve a mixed-methods approach with an eventual objective to translate my research insights into scalable and impactful technological solutions. With the constant push of AI based technologies into emerging markets, I am also interested in developing intelligent interfaces that make data more comprehensible by leveraging intuitive designs in interactive data visualizations. I believe this to be particularly impactful for promoting collaborations and productive discussions in a data-driven world.

Research areas: Data Science, HCI, User Behavior, Digital Humanity
